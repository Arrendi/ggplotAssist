This is an update of the package 'ggplotAssist'.

1) I had added an recursive shiny module "textFunctionInput" and "textFunction".

2) I have added several new functions.

3) I have added two toy shiny apps in the `inst` folder.

4) Several bugs fixed.


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
