This is the re-submission of the package 'ggplotAssist'

1) I have written package name and software name in single quotes (e.g. 'RStudio') in title and description.

2) I have omitted the redundant 'R' in 'R code' in description.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
